## What is it?
> AlterJS is a means of generating single transaction payloads, while joining in a joke a certain Polymer developer joked about regarding cross origin ritual sacrifices.

> I have also rigged up a little editor in main.js to be ran with, can share buffers, this acts as an example of how these classes can be used. Your imagination is the only limitation.

> Base64 encoding is very unstable right now, and performance goes out the window. Please avoid it for now. Also be sure to provide your own cert in the future but I have provided an example to start you off.

> This can be used in several ways, creating hot updatable routes, sharing buffers, meta programming, contacting daemons, aggrigating and scrapping, archival, security footprint minimization, do you. Also it is within my belief and attitude that lines of code - like words, are only a way of speaking to our computers - repeat what I'v already said if you want, but this is unsafe and not to be used in production.
